# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This repo/code has the ability for the user to generate a Team Profile. User would need to run code by entering "Node index.js" or name of server or file, inside of integrated terminal. Each profile includes Email, Id, and also varies from employee, meaning it would ask either a github username or school depending on employee.
